# Résumé help

When you are seeking a job, then you will likely want to send your résumé to people.

This page has quick tips for you.

## Write your résumé

- Start with your best contact information including email, phone, and relevant social links.

- Lead with a sentence in big type or bold type that says "Objective:" then clearly summarizes your objective.

- Explain your skills and experiences by using the STAR method.

- Limit your résumé to one page.

## Save your résumé

- Save your résumé as a PDF file.

- Name your résumé "your-name-resume.pdf" with all lowercase letters, with dashes, without spaces, without other punctuation.

## Send your résumé

- Send one link that goes to your résumé file.

- Verify that the link downloads your résumé file as a PDF file.

## Do Not

Do not send the person multiple links.

- Multiple links can cause a reader to lose track of your information.

- Multiple links are harder for your reader to share with other people who may be able to help you.

Do not send any other file format, such as a Word document, Excel spreadsheet, graphic image file, plain text file, etc.

- Complex file types may not work correctly on some systems.

- Plain text may not format correctly on some systems.

Do not use any other file name, such as with capital letters, or spaces, or other punctuation.

- File names with these other kinds of names don't work as reliably on as many systems.

- File names with these other kinds of names can interfere with your reader sharing your file.

Do not skip your contact information.

- This is because you want to make it as easy as possible for your reader to reach you.

- This is also because you want to provide any relevant links to your social networking (such as LinkedIn.com), your portfolio (such as Dribble.com), your source code (such as GitHub.com), and the like.

Do not skip your objective.

- This is because you want to be as clear as possible about what you want for your reader.

- This is also because you can customize your objective sentence to match your reader's goals, such as with a custom objective that matches a specific job description.

Do not skip the STAR method.

- This is because the STAR method has extensive evidence that it helps the reader understand your capabilities and successes.

- This is also because the STAR method works well with many widespread applicant tracking systems.
